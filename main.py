# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
x1=7 
x2=1
print(x1+x2)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator /

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length=5
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width=8
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area=length*width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f'the result is {area}')

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f'the length of a rectangle is {length}, and width is {width} then the area is :{area}')
